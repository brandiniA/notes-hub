---

# **Whatâ€™s with that name?**  

## **ðŸ”¹ The Marketing Behind JavaScript's Name**  
The name **JavaScript** was the result of **marketing strategies** rather than technical reasoning.  

- **Brendan Eich** initially code-named the language **Mocha** during its development.  
- Internally at **Netscape**, it was renamed **LiveScript**.  
- When it was time for a **public release**, the name **JavaScript** won the vote.  

### **Why "JavaScript"?**  
At the time, Java was one of the most popular programming languages, and:  
- **JavaScript was designed to appeal to Java developers.**  
- The word **"script"** was trendy and referred to lightweight programs.  
- JavaScript was initially **meant for small scripts embedded in web pages**.  

ðŸ“Œ **Important Note:** The **name is misleading**â€”JavaScript and Java are completely different languages!

## **ðŸ”¹ JavaScript vs Java: Superficial Resemblance**  
While JavaScript and Java share **some superficial syntax similarities**, they are **not related**.  

### **Shared Syntax from C/C++**  
Both JavaScript and Java (along with C and C++):  
- **Use `{}`** to define code blocks (functions, loops, conditionals).  
- **Use `;`** to end statements.  
- **Follow similar basic syntax conventions**.  

These similarities **made JavaScript easier to adopt** for developers familiar with C-based languages.

## **ðŸ”¹ The Ownership of "JavaScript"**  
- **Oracle owns the official trademark for the name "JavaScript"**.  
- However, this trademark is **rarely enforced** and likely **cannot be strictly upheld** anymore.  

ðŸ“Œ **For this reason, many developers prefer to use "JS" instead of "JavaScript".**  

---

## **ðŸ”¹ The Official Name: ECMAScript**  
- JavaScriptâ€™s official name, as defined by **TC39 and ECMA International**, is **ECMAScript**.  
- Since **2016**, each ECMAScript version is **suffixed with the release year**.  
  - Examples: **ES2016, ES2017, ES2018, ES2019**.  

ðŸ”¹ **Key takeaway:** JavaScript (JS) that runs in browsers or Node.js is an **implementation of ECMAScript**.
